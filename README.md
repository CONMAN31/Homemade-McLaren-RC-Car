# Homemade-McLaren-RC-Car
We designed a fully functioning McLaren 765LT model for a class project in our final year of College/ Cegep. It was a 2 month process dating back to October 9th 2024, and it ended November 26th 2024. The project began by an introduction of materials we needed, and through hard work in the lab sessions/outside of class, we successfully modeled it.
